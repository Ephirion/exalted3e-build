  "description": "<p><span style='font-family:Arial, Verdana, sans-serif'>This is the tale of a forgotten age before the seas were bent, when the world was flat and floated atop a sea of chaos. This is the tale of a decadent empire raised up on the bones of the fallen Golden Age, whose splendor it faintly echoed but could not match. This is a tale of primal frontiers, of the restless dead, of jeweled cities ruled openly by spirits in defiance of Heaven’s law. This is a tale of glorious heroes blessed by the gods, and of their passions and the wars they waged in the final era of legends.</span></p><p>This is your tale. This is <strong>Exalted</strong>. <em>What legends will they tell of your deeds?</em></p><p></p><p><strong>Exalted 3rd Edition includes:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>New Fiction</strong> - Read a new tale by original Exalted developer and author Geoff Grabowski.</li><li><strong>New Artwork</strong> – See the Realm in a new light with stunning artwork by both new and classic Exalted artists working under the direction of Maria Cabardo.</li><li><strong>Expanded Locales</strong> – Expand your campaigns with a detailed overview of the sprawling and decadent Second Age of Man.
