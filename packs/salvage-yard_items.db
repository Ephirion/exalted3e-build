Her metal-armored limbs deal lethal damage and use the traits of medium weapons when she makes unarmed attacks.

After being hit with an attack in close combat, the sorcerer may use this power to counterattack with a disarm gambit. This counterattack is both unblockable and undodgeable.</p><p></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">• Invincible God-Metal Flash (10m, 2a or 3a; Reflexive; Instant; Decisive-only)</span></strong></span>: When even the Invulnerable Skin of Bronze cannot withstand the force of an enemy’s blows, the sorcerer may shed it in a burst of protective Essence. While her anima is at the burning or bonfire level, she may use Invincible God-Metal Flash to reduce the raw damage of a decisive attack by her (Essence + 5), discharging her anima through the spell. The skin of bronze shatters as it absorbs the attack, and the sorcerer cannot cast it again until its original duration has elapsed. Her anima is returned to the dim level.</p><p></p><p>• <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sorcerer’s Impervious Mantle (4m; Reflexive; Instant; Withering-only)</span></strong></span>: The sorcerer’s Essence surges through her armored skin, reducing the minimum damage of a withering attack by one. A sorcerer who knows Invulnerable Skin of Bronze as her control spell may add her Essence to the soak and Hardness bonus she receives as long as she is unarmored. Even without the spell, her skin takes on a faint bronze tint. She may also add her Essence to her soak when the spell is not in effect.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Distortion (Goal Number: 12)</span></strong></span>: Distorting the spell forces the sorcerer to feel the full weight of her metal skin bearing down on her, imposing a -4 mobility penalty for one scene. If her total mobility penalty exceeds (the higher of her Strength or Athletics), then she loses the ability to take reflexive move actions, and must take a miscellaneous action to cross a range band even under normal circumstances.

{"type":"charm","system":{"description":"<p>Laying her mark upon the world, the Lunar claims a land as hers. She claims a single contiguous region no more than (Essence x 10) square miles as her territory. To do so, she must fully master the land she wishes to claim. She must physically traverse the majority of the region. Any mortal communities living in the territory must accept her presence — they need not make her their leader, but must acknowledge her presence and that they lack the ability or desire to force her out. </p><p></p><p>Finally, if any supernatural beings — such as spirits or fellow Exalted — occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Lunar must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. Land already claimed by another Lunar’s Boundary-Marking Meditation can’t be taken from him unless he voluntarily relinquishes it or dies. </p><p></p><p>Upon claiming a territory, the Lunar’s player chooses three qualities that describe it, e.g. fertile, shadowy, and dense for a thick forest, or open, windy, and guarded for a steppe village. When a character within the territory takes an action that’s supported by any of these qualities, like foraging in a fertile woodland, he’s treated as having an applicable specialty. When a character takes an action opposed by a quality, like a general enacting a Strategic Maneuver roll to march a large army through the dense forest, each such quality imposes a −1 penalty. </p><p></p><p>The Lunar never suffers these penalties. She can reflexively render a character she perceives immune to her territory’s penalties, or deny him its benefits. Story events may cause a territory to lose qualities — if the forest burns down, it’s no longer shadowy or dense.

After being hit with an attack in close combat, the sorcerer may use this power to counterattack with a disarm gambit. This counterattack is both unblockable and undodgeable.</p><p></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">• Invincible God-Metal Flash (10m, 2a or 3a; Reflexive; Instant; Decisive-only)</span></strong></span>: When even the Invulnerable Skin of Bronze cannot withstand the force of an enemy’s blows, the sorcerer may shed it in a burst of protective Essence. While her anima is at the burning or bonfire level, she may use Invincible God-Metal Flash to reduce the raw damage of a decisive attack by her (Essence + 5), discharging her anima through the spell. The skin of bronze shatters as it absorbs the attack, and the sorcerer cannot cast it again until its original duration has elapsed. Her anima is returned to the dim level.</p><p></p><p>• <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sorcerer’s Impervious Mantle (4m; Reflexive; Instant; Withering-only)</span></strong></span>: The sorcerer’s Essence surges through her armored skin, reducing the minimum damage of a withering attack by one. A sorcerer who knows Invulnerable Skin of Bronze as her control spell may add her Essence to the soak and Hardness bonus she receives as long as she is unarmored. Even without the spell, her skin takes on a faint bronze tint.

{"type":"charm","system":{"description":"Embodying the creative and destructive power of the Five Elemental Dragons, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a primal force not witnessed since Creation’s birth. Her anima banner flares to bonfire, straining with barely-contained force that mounts over the course of five hours. During this time, the Dragon-Blood can’t take any non-reflexive actions or movement actions. Anyone who can see her anima banner can tell that disaster is imminent; a difficulty 2 ([Intelligence or Perception] + Occult roll) reveals exactly how much time remains. The Dragon-Blood’s anima collapses, dispersing harmlessly, if she leaves Aura or is crashed, incapacitated, or forcibly moved by an enemy. After five hours uninterrupted, the Dragon-Blood expends her Aura and rolls (Intelligence + Lore), unleashing a blast that extends (successes/2) miles outwards. She and her Hearthmates are immune to the blast’s immediate consequences; she can use Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings (Dragon-Blooded, p. 282) to grant the same protection to all allied characters within medium range. The Storyteller determines how much damage the blast inflicts on mundane scenery and trivial opponents, up to uncountable damage. Affected battle groups must check for rout against difficulty 4. The blast’s other effects depend on its elemental aspect: Air: The sky darkens, pouring down harsh rain or heavy snowfall accompanied by gale-force winds and flashing lightning. • Precipitation imposes a –2 penalty on all vision- or hearing-based rolls. • Winds impose a –3 penalty on movement actions, ranged attacks, and similar rolls. • Airborne characters and trivial opponents treat all movement as difficult terrain. • Characters exposed to the storm suffer an environmental hazard with difficulty 2, Damage 10L/hour; a failed roll indicates they’ve been struck by lightning. The storm lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes / 2) hours, but can be dispersed earlier through magic or the creative actions of characters. Earth: The land shakes and grinds horrifically as seismic tremors shudder through it. • All characters within range must make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Athletics) balance roll or fall into a yawning chasm, suffering a falling damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232) unless they find a way to mitigate it. Climbing out requires a difficulty 3 ([Dexterity or Strength] + Athletics) roll, although characters may escape by other means, such as Monkey Leap Technique. • The damage wrought by the earthquake renders the entire area difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199), and the speed of any long-range travel through the affected area is halved. Fire: A roaring conflagration engulfs the land, setting the world ablaze. • All characters suffer a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 6L. • Forests, grasslands, wooden structures, and other flammable terrain catches fire and continues to burn with a lesser intensity (difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round) until they’re extinguished or no fuel remains. • A haze of smoke and ash hangs over the affected area, imposing a –2 penalty on any vision- or scent-based rolls. This lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes / 2) hours, unless dispersed earlier by natural weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters, and may last longer if large regions remain ablaze. Water: A swirling pillar of water descends from the sky or rises from the sea, before dispersing in all directions as a crushing tidal wave. • Depending on a character’s proximity to the Dragon-Blood, the amount of time they have to prepare for the wave’s impact varies — those within long range are struck by it instantly, without an opportunity to seek cover, while someone miles away from her might have minutes to prepare. • Characters unable to reach a place of safety before being hit must make a difficulty 5 ([Strength or Stamina] + Athletics) roll to avoid being carried away. If they fail, they’re knocked one range band away from the Dragon-Blood per success they failed by. If this movement is interrupted by hitting a barrier, the character takes damage as though he’d suffered a fall from a height equal to the number of range bands of movement prevented. • Ships caught in this wave suffer ten dice of Hull damage. Captains can roll (Wits + Sail) to avoid the worst of it, subtracting one die of damage per success. • The blast is also likely to cause mass flooding in valleys and similar areas. Wood: Gigantic vines burst from the ground, bearing vibrant flowers that bloom with toxic pollen. • The overgrowth renders the entire area difficult terrain and halves the speed of long-term travel through it, although travelers can potentially bypass this by setting fire to the vines or destroying them through other means. • Pollen imposes a –3 penalty on scent-based rolls. • The pollen is also an inhaled poison. The first time a character breathes in the affected area, and after each hour of exposure thereafter, they must roll against a poison with Damage 1B/minute, Duration 10 minutes, and a –3 penalty. The vines remain until destroyed, but their flowers wilt after (Dragon-Blood’s successes / 2) hours, ending the pollen haze. It can be dispersed earlier by natural weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters. The Dragon-Blood’s Hearthmates can contribute their Auras to this Charm, as long as they remain within short range and abide the same restrictions she does. Only one Aura of each element can be contributed, adding a non-Charm die on the Lore roll and conferring that element’s effects on the blast. The effects of different elements will combine without cancelling one another — Water and Fire, for example, would combine to unleash a scalding tsunami hot enough to set the battlefield afire. After using this Charm, the Dragon-Blood and all Hearthmates that contributed Auras suffer a –4 fatigue penalty on all rolls.

{"type":"charm","system":{"description":"The Lunar can half-absorb hearthstones, socketing them in her flesh. She gains absorbed hearthstones’ benefits as though they were socketed in an attuned artifact. Hearthstones that enhance weapons apply their benefit to her unarmed attacks and natural weapons, if appropriate, while hearthstones that enhance armor apply to her natural soak. Such effects are compatible with any magic that transforms parts of the Lunar’s body into weapons or armor. If she uses Last Warrior’s Unity (p. XX) to merge with an artifact weapon that has one or more empty hearthstone slots, she may treat absorbed hearthstones as being socketed in those slots for the duration.

{"type":"spell","system":{"description":"The sorcerer spits into her palm and conjures a black ceramic coin inscribed with sigils. She can place the coin wherever she likes, thereafter, if she concentrates and takes no other action, she may project her consciousness to the coin. She sees, hears and smells everything as if she stood at the coin’s location. If the coin is in a pocket, pouch or container with at least one opening, she can sense the environment both inside and outside that container. She senses only the inside of a container that is completely enclosed, such as a strongbox. Because she cannot project her sense of touch, she knows instantly if her body is shaken or injured. The sorcerer instinctively knows the distance of her senses from her body and the direction to the coin. She can find the coin just by traveling toward it, concentrating periodically to discover if it has moved.The sorcerer may only conjure a single coin at a time. If she has no further use for it, she may reflexively dispel her existing coin, which crumbles into dust, allowing her to form a new one. A sorcerer who knows Coin of Distant Vision as her control spell may project her senses to the coin’s location, occupying the space as if she was there. As she occupies the coin’s vicinity, her senses are identical to her senses in her body, and she may utilize sense-enhancing Charms. Distortion (Goal Number: 5): Distorting a coin causes the sorcerer’s senses to become foggy and unclear when projecting through coin, inflicting a -3 penalty on rolls to perceive through the coin. Storytelling Scrying Spells such as Coin of Distant Vision and Voices of Distant Regard are what may broadly be referred to as scrying magic, allowing the sorcerer to remotely view or listen to people when she is not present. Other sorcerers and mystical beings such as spirits and the Exalted may have means of blocking scrying magic, such as by performing sorcerous workings to ward against scrying, carrying an artifact which interferes with remote viewing or listening, or possessing spirit charms that conceal them from perception. Most means of blocking scrying magic automatically succeed, though at Storyteller’s discretion, a sorcerer may be allowed to roll to resist magic that blocks their scrying. Active scrying effects such as the Coin of Distant Vision can sense when they are being interfered with by warding magic, while passive scrying effects such as Voices of Distant Regard cannot.
